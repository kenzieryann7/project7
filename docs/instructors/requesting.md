# Requesting

## Your instructoral designer {docsify-ignore}

The instructional designer can review the multimedia project types on this web site so they can be informed on the web multimedia before discussing the course with the instructor.

The instructional designer should use the multimedia request form to request any of these projects.

Use Timeline multimedia type if you want a timeline.

All other project types should use Data+Viz.

When you submit the form, an Asana task is generated. When the project is approved by Victor, it is assigned to Nick Breslin for intake and development.


## Approval, Complexity, and Capacity {docsify-ignore}
Projects that don’t require additional development for an instructor (Timeline and Glossary) don’t have limits in a term. They’re simple to set up and configure.

Projects that require content entry (Labs, Worksheets) are easy to complete. We take additional time to ensure testing and accuracy for each lab is correct. We can typically get to these two terms prior to the course.

Projects that have complex content (Maps) or custom feature development are very limited. We will review all ‘approved’ projects at the start of a term and communicate if we are over capacity at that time. This means some projects that were approved will need to be simplified, or delayed to another term. We start on these one term prior to the course.
