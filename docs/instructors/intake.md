# Intake Meeting


An intake meeting is scheduled by Nick Breslin when appropriate for an approved project. The instructional designer, developer and instructor will meet to go over how web multimedia will fit into their course and help meet learning objectives for the students.

The goal of the intake meeting is to have a clear understanding of what the actionable items are for everyone involved, and the due dates for those items.

The developer will use the Questionnaire to help steer the intake process. Instructional designers should feel free to review any of the questionnaires or supplementals and share them with the instructor early in the course development process.

The outcome of the meeting will be recorded on the Asana task.
