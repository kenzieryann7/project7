# Developing with Ecampus

## Communication
All major milestones, decisions, and significant communications between developer and instructor will be recorded on the Asana task so that the instructional designer and the development team always have an up to date project status.

Most e-mail communication from developer to instructor will include the instructional designer to keep everyone aware of open questions and resolutions.

## Schedule
The development schedule is based on a 12-week development window based in the term prior to the course being due. These may not be exact for all projects, but they should serve as a general guide of how the web team works. This is a schedule that would be presented during the intake meeting.


Intake Meeting	Week 1-2
Content from Instructor	End of first month, usually Week 4-5
First review	Week 6
Second review	Week 9
Final review	Week 12, 2 weeks prior to start of term
Final changes implemented	Week 13
